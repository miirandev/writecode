# Code That Writes Code üñãÔ∏èüíª

Hey there! This Python script is your coding wingmate‚Äîit helps you generate snippets of code for various programming languages without breaking a sweat. It's like having a code-wizard buddy in your terminal. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

## What's This About?

Ever felt lazy to write the same "Hello, World!" for different languages? Or got frustrated figuring out if-else blocks in a new language? This script's got your back! It generates code snippets for common tasks like "Hello, World!", if-else statements, handling args, and more.

## Key Features

- **Multilingual Magic:** Supports Python, Rust, Go, JavaScript, Java, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Elixir, Julia, Ruby, Perl, Bash, Haskell, Scala, TypeScript, R, MATLAB, Clojure, Groovy, and Lua‚Äîlike a polyglot of code snippets!
- **Lazy Mode Enabled:** Just tell it which language and what operation you want‚Äîit'll whip up the code for ya!
- **Learn While You Type:** Explanations for stuff not supported in some languages‚Äîain't nobody got time for code confusion! but later, i'll add a function to explain the code printed

## Getting Started

1. **Setup:**

    - Make sure you've got Python installed.
    - Clone or download this repo‚Äîit's like inviting a friendly coding genie into your workspace!

2. **Running the Magic Spell:**

    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Jump into the script's directory.
    - Use this command (replace `<language>` and `<operation>`):

    ```bash
    python writecode.py <language> <operation> [--save]
    ```

    Example (saving an if-else block in Python):
    ```bash
    python writecode.py python ifelse --save
    ```

3. **Getting Creative:**

    - Dive into the `code_snippets` dictionary in the script to explore all supported languages and cool operations.
    - Some languages might not dance to certain beats, but the script spills the tea on what's supported and what's not for each language.
